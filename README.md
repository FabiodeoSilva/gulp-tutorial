# Getting Started
Gulp is a stream-based, JavaScript task runner that is derived from Node via NPM. It automates many of the tasks used in front end development, such as compressing files, linting syntax, and creating production versions of development files. Before we start, we need to install Node, which is packaged with NPM, and Gulp.
